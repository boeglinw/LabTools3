Installation
============

These instructions assume that you have all necessary software `requirements`_ installed and running.



**Important:**

Install ``LabTools3`` only **after** you have installed Anaconda or any
other python distribution you want to use.

There are several methods available for installation:

1. (Recommended) Download the installation script :download:`install_labtools.py<../install_labtools.py>`

2. From the command line run the command: ``pip install LabTools3`` (Make sure you have administrator priviledges on Windows, on MacOS or  Linux you might need to use the ``sudo`` command.)


Installation using Anaconda
---------------------------

Start **Spyder** and, using the file explorer, go to the directory (or folder) where you stored the ``install_labtools.py`` file.

.. _st_fig1:

.. figure:: pictures/anaconda_install.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 45%

   Figure 1: Select directory where you stored the ``install_labtools.py`` file.


In this directory execute the command ``%run install_labtools`` in the command window. If this does not work make
sure that you are in the correct directory (folder), look for ``install_labtools.py`` in the *Files* window.

This will install the software. Restart spyder and you are ready to use the ``LabTools3``.

Now you should be ready to do the start the `tutorial`_\ .
